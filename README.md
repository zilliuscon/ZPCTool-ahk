# ZPCTool-ahk

ZPCTool-ahk is a group of non-commercial software that i've put together that installs things automatically, originally intended for private use, now turned public. 

This will not automatically run the installers, you can configure it to on your own using the included autohotkey portable install, if you have a script that does.

# Tutorial

### simply drag the AHK file into the AHK portable folder, and drag the script you want into the exe.

## Overview
**Essentials.ahk** - software that's generally useful and any PC can use. ***(7zip, qBittorrent, Keepass, VLC, notepad++, LibreOffice, FileZilla)*** 

**Creative-Utility.ahk** - software that's very useful, and I feel is the strongest for creatives. ***(Krita, Blender, VLC, Shotcut, GIMP)***

**Browser.ahk** - changeably to whichever browser you prefer to use, just edit the download link. Default to ***Waterfox***.

***personal-install.ahk*** - if you feel you'd like to add extra apps yourself, you can use this script file as your base. go ahead and copy any download links you like! Includes **chocolatey** install script. 

***Zellie-Config.ahk*** - my personal public version of my auto installer. ***(includes all of the above)***
